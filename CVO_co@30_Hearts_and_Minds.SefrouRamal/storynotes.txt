Background: Climate change and late capitalism have ravaged Sefrou Ramal, with resource extraction companies jealously guarding their concessions,
and seeking to extract the last bits of value from the region. The Central government of Argana, based in a far away coastal province, have allowed local military leaders to manage regional affairs,
to disastrous results. The local Tura peoples began agitating for full independence, as well as their natural rights to the resources of the land. 
In response, the regional military governor, INSERT NAME, declared a military emergency in the region, and with the assistance of the French and the support of international corporations,
formed a seperatist de facto regional government. Extraction of natural resources ramped up drastically under the new government, exacerbating the pre-existing drought through heavy water use
in industrial processes, as well as the new government creating "strategic reserves" of water and food. Six months out from the beginning of the crisis, the situation has become desperate,
with the Tura disunited, water a precious and scarce resource, and the international community unsure of how to diffuse the conflict. 
In an attempt to prevent any one country being blamed for a disastrous intervention, The United Assistance program in Argana have hired on a nationless mercenary corps, the 24th Chorni Voron, 
to conduct humanitarian assistance, reconaissance, and if necessary, combat in support of the local civilian population, with the ultimate goal of creating an internationally recognised safe zone
for full-scale humanitarian efforts. The situation is fluid, and friends are thin on the ground. The 24th will need to be careful, discreet, and empathetic to successfully win over the 
local population, and prevent a horrific tragedy.
